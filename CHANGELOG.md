# Changelog

All notable changes to `botmaker-plugin-toolkit`.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this module uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). `release.sh` refuses to cut a version with no section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The module** — the eighth BotMaker repository, and the second one a plugin compiles against. It holds
  what `botmaker-studio-api` deliberately cannot: implementation. The contract is interfaces and records and
  must be allowed to version slowly, because a plugin's compiled classes cannot be rewritten; a widget kit is
  nothing but implementation and will move every time an editor does. Keeping them apart is what lets a
  plugin take a new toolkit without taking a new contract.
- **`Editors`** — six whole editors, each built from a `ValueContext` and needing nothing else:
  `region` (drag a rectangle on screen), `numbers` (a labelled tuple), `bounded` (a slider and read-out),
  `text`, `choice` and `gallery` (a grid of pictures). Extracted from the host's own thirteen pickers rather
  than designed, which is why there are six: these are the shapes that recurred.
- **`Pills`** — the summary-plus-menu control nine of those thirteen are. Its menu is rebuilt on opening,
  because an editor's choices depend on state that moves.
- **`Fields`** — a text field committing on Enter **and** on focus loss (either alone loses edits), a
  spinner clamped to its range, and a slider with a read-out for the numbers whose scale nobody knows.
- **`Modals`** — a numbers dialog and a thumbnail chooser, themed through `Theme` and owned through
  `Dialogs.owner()`. A plugin must not build its own `Stage`: with no theme it is unstyled JavaFX in the
  middle of a themed application, and with no owner it falls behind the editor. Cancelling calls nothing.
- **`Values`** — reading the `List<String>` a value arrives as. Every method degrades and never throws,
  because an editor that throws while building leaves a row of the Parameters window empty.
- **`Styles`** — the host's style-class names as constants. The smallest class here and the one a plugin
  cannot do without: the stylesheet is inside the host's jar, so there is no other way to learn the strings.
- **`Thumbnail`** — one cell of a picture chooser; a missing image is an ordinary state and renders as the
  label alone.

### Deliberately absent

- **Any third-party UI dependency.** ControlsFX's `PropertySheet` is a whole-form abstraction and these are
  bespoke single-value nodes; it would sit unused while every plugin resolved it. To be revisited only with
  a concrete need.
- **A form or validation layer.** A seventh widget is worth adding the day a second editor wants it.
