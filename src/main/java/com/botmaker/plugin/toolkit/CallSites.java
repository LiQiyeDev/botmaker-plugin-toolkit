/**
 * Predicates that choose an editor by <em>where</em> a value is used rather than by what type it is.
 *
 * <p>Most editors match on the type, and that is the better answer wherever it works: an editor chosen by
 * type is drawn in a bot's source <b>and</b> in the Parameters window. Some values cannot be told apart that
 * way. A Steam app id, a program path, a command-line flag and a window title are all {@code String}, and the
 * type says nothing about which of them a given slot holds — only the call around it does.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * static final Predicate<ValueContext> STEAM_APP_ID =
 *         CallSites.firstArgumentOf(Game.class, "launchSteam", "launchSteamIfNotRunning");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Every predicate here declines when there is no call</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ValueContext#asSlot()} answers {@code null} for a row of the Parameters window, and a row has no
 * call site by construction — there is no {@code Game.launchSteam(…)} behind a variable named {@code appId}.
 * Declining is the honest answer, and it is why an editor chosen this way is <b>absent</b> from that window
 * rather than misfiring in it. Plan for that: a value that must be editable in both places needs a
 * type-matched editor too, or it needs to be a type of its own.
 *
 * <h2>The class is matched by simple name, or by a qualified name ending in it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The host resolves the call out of the bot's own classpath and may hand back either spelling, and a
 * version of the plugin's library older than the one the editor is running against may have had the class in
 * a different package. Matching the tail is what keeps an old project's blocks drawing their real editors.
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a slot on somebody else's {@code Game} matches too, and a plugin for
 * which that is a real risk should give the value a type instead.
 *
 * <p>This is the generic half of a call-site editor. The <em>constants</em> — which class, which method names
 * — are the plugin's own vocabulary and stay with the plugin; nothing in this file names one.
