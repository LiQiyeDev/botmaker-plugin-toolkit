/**
 * The pill: a control that shows a value and opens a short menu of ways to change it.
 *
 * <p>Nine of the thirteen editors this toolkit was extracted from are this shape and nothing else — a
 * summary of the current value, and two or three actions behind it (<i>Select on screen…</i>, <i>Edit
 * values…</i>, <i>Clear</i>). It is a shape rather than a widget because what goes in the menu is entirely
 * the editor's business; what a plugin should not have to rediscover is the class name, the label-or-
 * placeholder rule, and that the menu must be rebuilt when it opens.
 *
 * <p><b>The menu is built on showing, not on construction, and that is load-bearing.</b> An editor's
 * choices routinely depend on state that moves — which windows are open, which templates exist, whether the
 * value is set yet. A menu built once shows the answer as it was when the block was first rendered.
