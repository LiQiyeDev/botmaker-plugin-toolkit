/**
 * How a widget in this kit asks the user to point at something on the screen.
 *
 * <p><b>This used to be the host's job and is not any more.</b> The plugin contract carried a {@code Capture}
 * service with exactly these three methods until 2026-08-31, defended on the grounds that only a host can put
 * a surface over its own windows. The maintainer's ruling is that the overlay and the desktop grab do not
 * belong to the editor at all — a full-screen surface over a running game, asking the user to point at
 * something in it, is about what a <em>bot</em> sees from end to end — so the service is deleted and a plugin
 * draws its own, over pixels it grabs itself through {@code botmaker-shared}, which is published.
 *
 * <p>That leaves this kit with a gap it cannot fill: {@link Editors#region} and {@link Editors#tuplePill} are
 * widgets whose whole point is a screen pick, and this module has one dependency and none of it is capture.
 * So the pick is supplied, not implemented — <b>the shape is the toolkit's and the pixels are the plugin's</b>,
 * which is the same split that keeps a bounded-number widget here and the table saying what the bound is in
 * the SDK.
 *
 * <p><b>Registered once, per plugin</b>, through {@link Editors#pickWith}. A static is the right shape here
 * for a reason particular to this platform: {@code PluginLoader} resolves the toolkit <em>child-first</em>, so
 * a plugin carrying its own copy gets its own classes and therefore its own value of that field. Two plugins
 * do not share one. A plugin that registers nothing gets {@link #NONE}, which does nothing and says so.
 *
 * <p>Every method is asynchronous and the callback runs on the JavaFX application thread. A cancelled pick
 * must <em>not</em> call back at all: an editor then leaves its slot as it found it rather than writing a
 * default over what the user had.
