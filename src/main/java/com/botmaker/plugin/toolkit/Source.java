/**
 * Java source, spelled correctly — the one place a plugin writes an expression a bot will compile.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is the toolkit's problem and not each plugin's</h2>
 *
 * <p>A plugin that registers a value type is emitting Java whether it thinks so or not:
 * {@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.value.ValueCodec#literal} returns Java source, and
 * {@link Slots#write} writes Java into a slot. Before this class there were three hand-rolled copies of
 * string escaping in this project alone — one here, one in the SDK, one in the generated plugin skeleton —
 * which is what a concern with no owner looks like. A wrong escape is not a compile error in <em>this</em>
 * build; it is a compile error in somebody's <em>bot</em>, reported against a line they did not write.
 *
 * <h2>An argument is source, not a value — and since 2026-09-01 the compiler says so</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #newInstance} takes arguments that are already Java. The rule used to be documented and
 * unenforced: the parameter was {@code Object...}, so passing {@code "ding"} emitted {@code ding} — a
 * reference to a variable nobody declared. Both spellings are valid Java and only the caller knows which was
 * meant, so the distinction has to be in the type. It is {@link Expr}: {@link #string}, {@link #number} and
 * their friends return one, a bare {@link String} is not accepted, and the one way to pass unchecked text is
 * {@link #code}, which says at the call site that the caller took responsibility for it.
 *
 * <h2>There is no {@code call}, and a method reference is not what replaced it</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code call(Class<?>, String method, Expr...)} lived here from 2026-08-28 to 2026-09-04 and was
 * deleted with <b>no production caller</b>: the one place that wanted it — the SDK's macro translator —
 * declined it, because a recorded macro is pasted into a user's file where the type is imported and
 * {@code call} qualifies it in full. What is left of it is {@link #requireMethod}, which is the half worth
 * keeping: anybody composing a call by hand can still ask whether the name resolves.
 *
 * <p><b>A compile-checked method reference was considered and is not possible here.</b> {@code call(Mouse::click)}
 * needs a functional interface whose <em>shape matches the method</em>, so arbitrary arity means one
 * interface per parameter count — which is exactly the {@code MemberRef} plus {@code M0}–{@code M5}
 * apparatus this project built for {@code PaletteCatalog} and deleted on 2026-08-27, and a method reference
 * still cannot name a specific overload. Do not re-propose it without an arity-free form, and there is none.
 *
 * <h2>JavaPoet is the implementation and never the interface</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every member here takes and returns {@link String} or this class's own {@link Expr}, so no JavaPoet
 * type reaches a plugin's signature and the library can be replaced without a toolkit release that breaks
 * anybody. A plugin that wants JavaPoet directly is free to declare it.
