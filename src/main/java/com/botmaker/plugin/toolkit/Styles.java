/**
 * The host's own style-class names, as constants.
 *
 * <p>This is the smallest class here and the one a plugin cannot do without. A plugin's editor is attached
 * to a scene the host has already themed, so it inherits the host's stylesheet for free — but only for the
 * classes that stylesheet actually names. A node with no class, or with a class of the plugin's own
 * invention, renders as unstyled JavaFX in the middle of a themed application, and the plugin author has no
 * way to discover the right string: the stylesheet is inside the host's jar.
 *
 * <p><b>These are names, not a look.</b> What each one renders as is the host's to change, and changes with
 * the theme the user picked — which is the point. A plugin that hard-codes a colour matches the application
 * once; a plugin that names a class matches it after the next release too.
 *
 * <p>Every widget in this toolkit applies the right ones already. Reach for these directly only when
 * building a node the toolkit does not cover.
