 * One cell of a picture chooser: what the user sees, and what gets written if they pick it.

 * pictures in it — an image template, a template group, a game's cover art, an emulator's screen — so the
 * grid is the widget and this is its item.
 *
 * @param value what {@link com.botmaker.plugin.api.ValueContext#set(String)} is called with; never shown
 * @param label the caption under the picture, and what is shown when there is no picture
 * @param image the picture, or {@code null} — a missing image is an ordinary state (a template whose file
 *              was deleted, cover art that never downloaded) and renders as the label alone
