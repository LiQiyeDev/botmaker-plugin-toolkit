/**
 * Contexts a plugin's editors can be exercised against without a running Studio.
 *
 * <p>A {@code SlotEditor} is a predicate and a factory over a {@link ValueContext}, and both halves are worth
 * a test: <em>does this predicate claim the calls I meant and decline the ones I did not</em>, and <em>does
 * this factory build a node and write back what I expect</em>. Neither question needs a host, a project or a
 * JavaFX thread — but until this class existed every plugin author had to write the two stubs first, which is
 * enough friction that the predicate half generally went untested.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * var ctx = TestContexts.slot("Game", "launchSteam", 0, "\"440\"");
 * assertTrue(STEAM_APP_ID.test(ctx));
 * assertFalse(STEAM_APP_ID.test(TestContexts.row("appId", "440")));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>What is real and what is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>The value, the type, the call site and the writes are <b>real</b>: {@link Recording#written()} and
 * {@link Recording#replacement()} return exactly what the editor asked for, so a test asserts on the string
 * that would have reached the file. {@link ValueContext#services()} is <b>not</b>: it answers {@code null},
 * because every one of those services is the host doing something a test has no way to fake — dragging a
 * region on a real screen, owning a real window. An editor that reaches for one in a test fails with an NPE
 * naming the line, which is the honest outcome; test that editor's <em>predicate</em> here and its dialog by
 * hand.
 *
 * <p>Building a JavaFX control still needs the FX toolkit started. That is JavaFX's rule, not this class's:
 * run those tests on an initialised toolkit, or keep to the predicates, which touch no control at all.
